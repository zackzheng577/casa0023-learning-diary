Reflection

This week focused on learning how to communicate remote sensing concepts through online presentations and learning diaries. Creating a Xaringan presentation encouraged me to think critically about structure, clarity and audience, rather than technical detail alone. Embedding the presentation within a Quarto learning diary highlights how analytical workflows and communication can be integrated into a single reproducible and publicly accessible portfolio.
